# Salesforce-Administrator-Virtual-Internship
This repository contains my Salesforce Administrator Virtual Internship experience at Salesforce. During the internship, I developed training and documentation for users, monitored and optimized Salesforce performance, and built custom processes and Lightning components to enhance business workflows and user adoption.
